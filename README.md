# VoltaML_Assignment
This repo is created as a part of assignment for VoltaML intern hiring. There are two models developed, one in the domain of computer vision and the other one in the domain of NLP

PROJECT TITLE 1:- Image Classification



DATA SET :- CIFAR10




DESCRIPTION :- Dataset as it suggests has 10 different categories of images in it. There is a total of 60000 images of 10 different classes naming Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck. All the images are of size 32×32. There are in total 50000 train images and 10000 test images.
To build an image classifier we make use of tensorflow‘ s keras API to build our model. In order to build a model, it is recommended to have GPU support, or you may use the Google colab notebooks as well.













PROJECT TITLE 2:- Name Entity Relation











DATASET :- CONLL_2003 Dataset
















DESCRIPTION :-he goal of Named entity recognition is to classify each token (word) in a sentence into certain class. The most common NER systems available freely in the Internet can identify PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION etc. There are several applications of NER and can be a part of your NLP pipeline for numerous tasks.


















***Installation and Use***
Since, the datasets are open sourced there is no need of downloading but for reference there are datasets attached in this same repository.
